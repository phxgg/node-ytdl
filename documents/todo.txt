TODO:

public/js/main.js#50 (revokeObjectURL)
create video download (heroku responds with timeout when converting a big video)
Maybe show video thumbnail and other info when filling the URL, before clicking Convert (also find a way to keep the videoInfo stored so we don't have to re-grab the info when clicking convert)
on POST requests, check if csrf token is invalid and handle the error

Not in priority:

Do not allow users to spam with too many post requests
